Project Title

A simple Tensorflow CNN that can detect the presence of malignant cancer in skin lesions.
Description
    This is a python script that uses Keras and Tensorflow's Convolutional Neural Network systems to read in a set of training data, learn from it, and predict whether new data is cancerous or benign based off its knowledge.

Getting Started
Dependencies

    Tensorflow
    Anaconda
    Tensorboard Visual Studio Code Extension
Installing

    Change all directories in test(2.5).py and CNN.py to match your current system's directories.

Executing program

To run this, you must first download the HAM10000 dataset and have it locally on your computer.
From there, open test(2.5).py and change all the directories specified to match on your system.
Run test(2.5).py. This will create directories and sort your dataset into the format required by the model.
From there, open CNN.py and change the directories according to how it is set up on your PC. 
Have Tensorflow and Anaconda installed, and then run the model.
To access Tensorboard, ensure you have the extension installed in Visual Studio code, and then hit CTRL+Shift+P.
You should see the command bar open up and from there, hit "Python: Launch Tensorboard". 


Help
Ensure all backslashes (\) are replaced with frontslashes (/) in all directories.
Lower batch size if running out of memory.
